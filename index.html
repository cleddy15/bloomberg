              3-minute video of the vehicle idling.</p>

      <p>The city unveiled a new anti-idling campaign late last month, which allows
        New Yorkers to cash in on the fine the driver will eventually be charged.</p>

      <p>Mayor de Blasio announced the initiative with help from 80’s rock singer Billy Idol.
        Standing in front of signs that read “WAR ON IDLING” and “Billy doesn’t idle,” the
        mayor explained how New Yorkers can take home some of the fine.</p>

      <p>“Idling is just stupid. We all do it but we don’t need to,” he said, noting how he’s obsessed with not doing it. </p>

      <p>Fumes from idling vehicles have a negative impact on the environment and can also have lasting health effects, including increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke, worsening asthma and in worst case scenarios, premature death. If
        someone can capture a 3-minute long video of the
        vehicle idling, then they’ll get a quarter of the ticket to keep for themselves. </p>

      <p>"The only way you’re going to change that financial sense is through higher
        fines or more serious enforcement,” said senior air quality consultant Kevin Edwards.</p>
      <p>While a good idea in theory, some are worried about how successful New Yorkers will be in capturing a video of that length
        and how the city will be able to verify the vehicle is actually on. </p>
      <p>Any vehicle idling next to a school for more than one minute is also subject to a fine. The only exception to this rule are emergency vehicles, which typically have to stay on in order for the personnel to do their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>When asked if Idol actually drives in Manhattan, the singer explained that he rides a motorcycle—and lives in Los Angeles.
